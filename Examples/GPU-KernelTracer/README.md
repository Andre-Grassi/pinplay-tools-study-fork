# Overview
This directory has combined GPU+CPU analysis tools.

- CPU-Pin is used to drive everything, it loads a specified GT-Pin tool shared library and initializes it.  Hence both CPU and GPU instrumentation/analyses are active at the same time in the same process.

See README.md files in individual directories for more details.
